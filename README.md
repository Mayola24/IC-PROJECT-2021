Abstract - The human face plays an important role in
knowing an individual's mood. The required input are
extracted from the human face directly using a camera.
One of the applications of this input can be for extracting
the information to deduce the mood of an individual.
This data can then be used to get a list of songs that
comply with the “mood” derived from the input provided
earlier. This eliminates the time-consuming and tedious
task of manually Segregating or grouping songs into
different lists and helps in generating an appropriate
playlist based on an individual's emotional features.
Facial Expression Based Music Player aims at scanning
and interpreting the data and accordingly creating a
playlist based the parameters provided. Thus our
proposed system focus on detecting human emotions for
developing emotion based music player, which are the
approaches used by available music players to detect
emotions, which approach our music player follows to
detect human emotions and how it is better to use our
system for emotion detection.
